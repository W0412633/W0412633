Short-term:


Long-term:

Home page:
Maybe some kind of four-corners deal, things that define me or whatever, intro sort of idea
Adventure (risk-taking), Music (creative), Vintage computing/gaming (compatible), Tinkering (performance)

Goals:
Don't know about keeping the table, most logical but kind of ugly and rigid
Goals themselves, yeesh, that'll take a dog's age, probably doesn't matter all that much really

Resume:
Embedment would be easiest, but if it looks crap will have to re-write resume in HTML

Skills:
Uhhh..., yeah..., something...

Contact:
Name, phone, email, no street address though. Nice big icons for sure.
