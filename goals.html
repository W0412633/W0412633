		<p>Hey there! I&#39;m Jacob and I&#39;ve been a student of IT at the Nova Scotia
		Community College for the best part of a year now. I hope to be a fully-fledged
		programmer by the time I complete my diploma, and enter the workforce as one.
		I&#39;m a dedicated student and quick learner, eager to take on programming challenges!</p>

				<td>One of the key reasons to attend any learning institution, college or university, is to meet with like-minded people
					and potential employers. I will utilize the events and programs put in place by NSCC, such as job fairs and workshops,
					as well as meet-and-greets that go on outside the college. I intend to get my name into the industry both to veterans of
					the IT field and students like myself, eager to break in.
				</td>
				<td>I wish to get my foot in the door as soon as possible, to understand the skills necessary and the expectations of holding
					an IT job in the real world. I am a driven, quick learner, and I recognize that the technologies taught and studied in
					school are just as important as the broader life lessons acquired as a member of the workforce.
				</td>
				<td>As I am still studying at NSCC, my most crucial goal is to broaden my skillset. I currently have experience programming in
					Python, writing HTML and CSS, as well as some introductory knowledge of BASIC and JavaScript. Through my progression of the
					diploma, I will become familiar with Java, C++, advanced programming concepts, among other skills that will be invaluable to
					future employment and success.					
				</td>
				<td>I have always felt close to my community, and help others when I can. After gaining more experience and skills in my area
					of study, I wish to give back in whatever I can through use of my programming talent. Perhaps creating a website for a local
					non-profit, or a game that is accessible to the disabled, or something else that will improve the lives of fellow Haligonians.
				</td>
				<td>My ultimate goal in the short-term is to complete the IT Programming Diploma and graduate from NSCC. The employer connections
					provided by the college as well as the expert instructors who design courses that drive home real world skills will be excellent
					tools with which to enter the workforce. This will also be important milestone, and bring on greater freedom and responsiblity.

				<caption>Long Term Goals</caption>
				<tr>
					<th>Obtain a Fulfilling Career</th>
					<th>Contribute Meaningful Work</th>
					<th>Personal Growth Through My Career</th>
					<th>Achieve Financial Stability</th>

				<tr>
					<td>Looking further into the future, I hope to settle into a job that not only pays well or has a quick commute, but provides
						fulfillment and pride. Programming can be more than just work, whether that be creating art or a valuable tool, and I hope
						to be a part of such a project in my future.
					</td>
					<td>I want to create programs that can help others as well. Creating algorithms that can assist handicapped people, or games 
						that can improve the lives of those with learning disabilities is an endeavour that I am eager to pursue. Using my skills
						to make things that can improve the lives of those less fortunate is something I am very dedicated to.
					</td>
					<td>I also want my career to challenge my perceptions, open me to new points of view, and introduce me to people from far and
						wide. People spend upwards of 40 years in their field between entering it and retiring, and I would hate to be the same
						person in the beginning and the end.
					</td>
					<td>As a student currently, finance is more a question of how much debt are you in as opposed to your net worth. I want a career
						that rewards me fairly for my contributions, and that I can support a family on. I aim for a job that allows me to own a home,
						a car and some luxuries besides.
					</td>
					<td>Lastly, I hope that upon building my name in the corporate world, I am given the opportunity to travel outside of Canada to
						see all different parts of the world. Whether through business or pleasure, traveling is one of my favourite activities and
						I believe an enormous amount can be learned from the culture and people of other nations. A whole lifetime spent in one town
						is a sheltered life indeed.
